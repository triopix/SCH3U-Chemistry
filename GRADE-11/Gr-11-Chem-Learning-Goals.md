>##### Unit 1: Learning Goals
>- **Distinguish** between atomic number and atomic mass (mass number) AND how these relate to isotopes and radioisotopes
>- Apply the concept of **isotopes** in the real world situations
>- Describe the Bohr-Model of the atom and be able to visualize the quantum model
>- Describe atomic/ionic radius trends, ionization energy/electron affinity, and electronegativity trends
>- Draw **Lewis Structures**  for Ionic and Molecular compounds 
>- Explain properties of non-polar vs polar covalent compounds and IMF's
