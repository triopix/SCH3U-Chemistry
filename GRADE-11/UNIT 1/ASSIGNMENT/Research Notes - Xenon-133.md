Xenon-133 is a **radioactive isotope** of the noble gas xenon. It is also known as a Radiopharmaceutical. These are used as radioactive agents to treat diseases and complications in the body.

- Xenon-133 is a specific isotope of xenon, a chemical element with the atomic number 54.
- It is a radioactive isotope, which means it undergoes spontaneous radioactive decay.
- Xenon-133 is commonly used in medical imaging, specifically in lung ventilation/perfusion scans.
- It is a safe and inert gas, making it suitable for inhalation by patients during diagnostic procedures.
- Xenon-133 emits beta and gamma radiation, which can be detected by specialized equipment to create images of lung ventilation and blood flow.

- Xenon-133 is used for the medical diagnosis of different lung problems (specifically these tests are called lung perfusion tests). Usage of this type of method only used in North America.
- Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) to image the lungs, heart and brain by utilizing the gamma radiation that is given off in gamma decay.
- Also used for patients with severe respiratory complaints and pulmonary/cardiovascular problems and disorders such as embolisms.
- It also helps in the identification and measurement of cerebral blood flow
- 



















4. Explain how your isotope works
- Xenon Xe-133 is a diffusible gas not produced or utilized by the body.
- It freely moves through cell membranes and exchanges between blood, tissue, and body fat.
- It has a higher concentration in body fat than in blood, plasma, water, or protein solutions.
- Physiologically, at recommended diagnostic concentrations, it is inactive.
- When inhaled, Xenon Xe-133 enters the alveolar wall and pulmonary venous circulation via capillaries.
- The majority of the gas inhaled in a single breath is returned to the lungs and exhaled after passing through the peripheral circulation once.
