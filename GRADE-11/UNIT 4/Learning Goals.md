**Unit 4: Solutions and Solubility 

Your Learning Goals for this Unit: 

- Describe what a solution is, and be able to use terms such as: homogeneous, heterogeneous, miscible, immiscible, saturated, dilute, concentrated, etc. to describe a solution. 
    
- Understand the mole concept and the relationship between mass, moles, and molar concentrations in chemical reactions. 


**These are the main concepts:**

- Understand the concept of dilution and use calculations to make diluted solutions in a lab setting 
    
- Be able to perform various calculations involving solutions stoichiometry 
    
- Understand the difference between acids & bases, pH formula, and learn the titration lab technique**
