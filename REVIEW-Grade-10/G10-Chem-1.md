Qualitative vs. Quantitative:

###### Qualitative:
- Described using *words*

###### Quantitative:
- Described using *numbers*

___
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Physical Changes:
> - Alter or affect the *form* or *state* of a substance
> - E.g - melting, freezing, boiling, breaking a rock into smaller pieces

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Chemical Changes
> - Transform a substance into a new substance
> - The new substance has different chemical formation and chemical properties
> 	- E.g the milk is sour, wood burns, iron rusts
> 	- The change happens at a chemical/atomic level
> - Look for proof!

Let's check the differences:

>[!ATTENTION]
> Physical Property
> - Description that helps to identify a substance 
> 	- E.g. colour, state, boiling point
> 	- Determined without changing the substance into another substance 
> 
> Chemical Property
> - How a substance *reacts* with other substances to form *new* substances
> - The process by which the substance *changes* is called a chemical reaction

**Types of Physical Properties**

1. Malleability: A solid that can be hammered/bent into different shapes
2. Ductility: A solid that can be pulled into wires
3. Melting/Boiling Points: The temperature at which a substance melts or boils
4. Solubility: Ability of a substance to dissolve in a solvent such as water
5. Viscosity: How easily a liquid flows (thicker liquid is more viscous)
6. Density: How much heavier the particles of one substance are over another
___

**Types of Chemical Properties**

1. Combustibility: A substance that burns when exposed to a flame
2. Reactivity with Acid: Metals react with acid to produce a gas
___

What is *==matter==*?

Matter: Anything that takes up **space** and occupies **volume**

> [!INFO] Classification of Matter
> - Pure Substances: Only made up of one **type** of particle
> - Mixtures: Made up of **different** types of particles
> - Elements: Made up of atoms
> - Compounds: Made up of two or more elements

### Classification of Matter - Continued

__==Heterogeneous Mixtures==__

- Heterogeneous mixtures have many phases 

	***Colloids***
	- a heterogeneous mixture with particles that never *settle*
	- Examples: milk, paint, fog, smoke

___

__==Homogeneous Mixtures==__

- Homogeneous mixtures (solutions) have **ONLY ONE** phase

___
