### **Word Equations**

> [!NOTE] *Word Equations* - what do they mean?
> 	- Describes the chemical changes using the names of the reactant and products

Example:

> [!EXAMPLE] Write the word equation for the reaction of **methane gas** with **oxygen gas** to form **carbon dioxide** and **water**

Left: Reactant
Right: Product

*Methane* + *Oxygen* --> Carbon Dioxide + Water

> [!ATTENTION] 
> ##### Subscripts - States of Matter
> - (s) - solid
> - (l) - liquid
> - (g) - gas
> - (aq) - aqueous
> 
> ***(∆)*** - used to add heat above arrow

___
> [!EXAMPLE]
> ##### Solid Mercury (II) oxide decomposes to *produce* liquid mercury metal and gaseous oxygen


__Mercury (II) oxide (s)  → Mercury (l)  +  oxygen (g)__
